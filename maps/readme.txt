** NOTES:
1- Both the X and Y coordinates are counted on a 0-based position, so the first position will always be [0,0].
2- Take in consideration that the first set of coordinates includes the offset included into the downloaded TSV file of 5 newlines and 5 tabs. The second set of coordinates (after the arrow) assumes that the first “F” square is in position 0,0 of your file.
